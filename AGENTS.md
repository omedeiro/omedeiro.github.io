# Agent Instructions — owenmedeiros.com

Personal site built with Astro, deployed to Cloudflare Workers (static assets) at https://owenmedeiros.com.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # local dev server
npm run build     # outputs to dist/
npm run preview   # preview production build
```

Deploys run automatically via Cloudflare Workers Builds on push to `main` (build command: `npm run build`; wrangler serves `dist/` as static assets).

## Structure

- `src/layouts/Base.astro` — site shell: nav, footer, all global CSS (single-column, minimal design)
- `src/layouts/Md.astro` — wrapper for markdown pages (renders `title` frontmatter as `<h1>`)
- `src/pages/` — all pages; markdown files use `layout: ../layouts/Md.astro` frontmatter
- `public/` — static assets (images, PDFs, `.m` files) served at root paths
- `wrangler.jsonc` — Cloudflare Worker config; custom domain `owenmedeiros.com`
- `astro.config.mjs` — redirects (`/contact`→`/about`, `/publications`→`/research`, `/thesis`→`/research`), math rendering (remark-math + rehype-katex)

## Adding pages

1. Create `src/pages/section/page-name.md` with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: ../../layouts/Md.astro   # depth-relative path
   title: Page Title
   ---
   ```
2. Images go in `public/section/` and are referenced with absolute paths (`/section/file.png`).
3. Add a link from the relevant index page (`src/pages/projects/index.md` etc.) — there is no auto-generated nav for content pages.

## Design rules

- Match darioamodei.com aesthetic: single ~42rem column, serif body, small sans-serif nav, no cards/grids/sidebars, no client-side JS.
- All styling lives in `Base.astro`; do not add per-page CSS files.
- LaTeX math works in markdown via `$...$` / `$$...$$` (KaTeX CSS loaded from CDN).

## Content guidelines

**Never invent personal details:**
- No biographical filler ("passionate developer...")
- No assumed career history or education
- Stick to documented projects and technical facts
- If personal content is needed, ask the user

**Prefer concise technical content:** direct statements, specific tech details, real implementation notes.

## Publications

`src/pages/research.md` holds a static publications list. `references.bib` and `scripts/fetch_scholar.py` are kept for regenerating entries; update the markdown manually when new papers appear.

## Release / PR workflow (agent-driven changes)

All non-trivial changes (content edits, new pages, config changes) follow this process:

1. **Branch** — never commit directly to `main`. Create `feature/<short-slug>` from an up-to-date `main`.
2. **Version bump** — update `"version"` in `package.json` (semver). **Default to a patch bump** for most changes (content tweaks, link/copy edits, asset updates). Use minor for new pages/features, major only for site-wide redesigns or migrations.
3. **Changelog** — add a `## x.y.z — YYYY-MM-DD` entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` with `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Removed` subsections as applicable.
4. **Verify** — run `npm run build` and confirm it succeeds.
5. **Commit** — one commit including the change, version bump, and changelog. Concise imperative subject line.
6. **PR** — push the branch and open a PR with `gh pr create` (summary of what/why).
7. **Merge** — use a **merge commit** (`gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`), matching repo history. Then `git checkout main && git pull`.

Deploys to production happen automatically on merge to `main` via Cloudflare Workers Builds.

## Git LFS

PDFs tracked via LFS (`.gitattributes`). If pushing fails with "git-lfs not found":
```bash
git lfs install
git push
```
